As America slowly opens up its borders and accepts more immigrants, new immigrants need to understand which cities can best accommodate them based on their unique situations.  	

In this investigation, we analyze 27 counties in New York to provide new immigrants with suggestions on which counties to reallocate that would maximize their success in starting to achieve the American dream.
By helping immigrants reallocate to counties that accommodate the unique situations of the different types of new immigrants, the government can prevent the following:
	- High levels of unemployment among new immigrants
	- Reduce reallocation anxiety 
	- Degraded standards of living 
	- New immigrants leaving the country	

Top Recommendations Based on Wage Levels:
High-Wage Top Choices: New York City, Albany
Med-Wage Top Choices: Utica, Elmira
Low-Wage Top Choices: Utica
